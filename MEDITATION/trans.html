            <p>Dr. Ramchandra Dutt, a relative of Narendra who had been raised in his house was a disciple of Shri
                Ramkrishna Paramhansa. He noticed that Narendra was inspired by religious feelings to such an extent
                that he was contemplating renunciation in his childhood itself. He once told Narendra, “Brother, if your
                only goal in life is to further the enhancement of our religion, then do not get involved in the Bramho
                Samaj or others. You go to Dakshineshwari and meet Shri Ramkrishna.” Narendra met Shri Ramkrishna at his
                neighbor Surendranath’s house itself. Initially for some days Shri Ramkrishna did not allow Narendranath
                to leave his side even for a moment. He made Narendra sit next to him and gave him much advice &
                counsel. The two of them would have great discussions when alone.

                Shri Ramkrishna had decided to give Narendra the responsibility of carrying on his incomplete mission.
                One day Shri Ramkrishna wrote on a piece of paper, “Narendra will perform the task of enlightening the
                masses.” Somewhat hesitantly Narendranath replied, “I won’t be able to do all this.” Shri Ramkrishna
                immediately spoke with great resolve, “What? Won’t be able? Your bones will perform this task?” Later
                Shri Ramkrishna initiated Narendranath on the path of Sanyas and gave him the name Swami Vivekanand.</p>
