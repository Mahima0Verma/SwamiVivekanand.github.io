        Right from childhood, two
        aspects of his behavior could clearly be noticed. One was his devout and compassionate nature and the other was
        his readiness to perform any act of courage. Since his whole family was spiritually inclined, he received an
        appropriate religious upbringing.

        Swami Vivekananda was admitted to the school founded by Mr. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar in 1870. While in school he
        focused both on studies as well as body building. He had great respect for his mother tongue.

        One such incident
        was when he had and English language class in school, he said, “I shall not learn the language of the white
        master.” At least for 7 – 8 months he abstained from learning that language. Later he learnt English owing to
        compulsion.

        <br>
        Swami Vivekananda stood first in his matriculate examination and added to the glory of his family
        and school. Then he joined the Presidency College in Kolkata and completed his M.A. in Philosophy.
