                    A spiritual genius of commanding intellect and power, Swami Vivekananda crammed immense labor and
                    achievement into his short life (1863–1902). Born Narendranath Datta, Vivekananda in his youth was
                    fascinated by the agnostic Western schools of philosophy.At the same time, vehement in his desire to
                    know the truth about God, he questioned people of holy reputation, asking them if they had seen God.
                    He found such a person in Sri Ramakrishna, who became his master, allayed his doubts, guided him on
                    the spiritual path, and transformed him into sage and prophet with authority to teach.

                <p class="center">
                    Dr. Ramchandra Dutt, a relative of Narendra who had been raised in his house was a disciple of Shri
                    Ramkrishna Paramhansa. He noticed that Narendra was inspired by religious feelings to such an extent
                    that he was contemplating renunciation in his childhood itself. He once told Narendra, “Brother, if
                    your only goal in life is to further the enhancement of our religion, then do not get involved in
                    the Bramho Samaj or others. You go to Dakshineshwari and meet Shri Ramkrishna.” Narendra met Shri
                    Ramkrishna at his neighbor Surendranath’s house itself. Initially for some days Shri Ramkrishna did
                    not allow Narendranath to leave his side even for a moment. He made Narendra sit next to him and
                    gave him much advice & counsel. The two of them would have great discussions when alone.

                    Shri Ramkrishna had decided to give Narendra the responsibility of carrying on his incomplete
                    mission. One day Shri Ramkrishna wrote on a piece of paper, “Narendra will perform the task of
                    enlightening the masses.” Somewhat hesitantly Narendranath replied, “I won’t be able to do all
                    this.” Shri Ramkrishna immediately spoke with great resolve, “What? Won’t be able? Your bones will
                    perform this task?” Later Shri Ramkrishna initiated Narendranath on the path of Sanyas and gave him
                    the name Swami Vivekanand.

                    Swami Vivekananda along with Taraknath, another disciple of Ramkrishna, established the Ramkrishna
                    Mission after Mahasamadhi of Shri Ramkrishna Paramhansa. It began its activities from a dilapidated
                    building at Varahnagar, near Kolkata. Earlier it was believed that this place was a haunted house.
                    Vivekanandakept Shri Ramkrishna’s mortal ashes and some other objects used by him, at this place.
                    Soon Shri Ramkrishna’s disciples started living there.

                        mind saves us and frees us from such thoughts.
